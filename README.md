# odin-todo-list
In this project I've built a todo list web application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The skills on display in this project are:
-JavaScript: DOM manipulation, event handling, array methods, modules
-Client-side persistence: localStorage for saving todos
-HTML: semantic markup and form handling
-UX & state management: input validation, state updates, filtering/sorting todos
-Code quality: separation of concerns, readable code
